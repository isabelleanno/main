             I had a lot of fun with this project and I'm very proud of the final
        product. I drew the outlines of each vegetable and organized them into
        different layers, then I selected them using mostly free select, but
        also with the path tool, and created a new layer called "colors" which
        has all the background colors of each plant. Then at the end, I
        transformed the colors layer a little bit down and to the left to add
        some depth and character to the drawing- that's why the outlines don't
        match the edge of the colors exactly. I like the effect because it makes
        everything pop out a little bit. Lastly, I used gradients on the
        background ot make it more interesting, and on the cucumber slice, as
        they are whiter in the center and I wanted to illustrate that.

              For this image, I used the gradient tool on the moon to make it
          lighter at the top. This adds depth and character, and matches the
          color difference between the sheep's face and the rest of his fur. To
          get the outline of the moon, I made a temporary layer with a black
          circle, and added a smaller white circle to overlap it, creating the
          crescent shape. Then in a new layer, I traced what was left of the
          black circle with the Bezier Curve tool, and modified the points until
          I got a smooth shape. To make the sheep, I used the pencil tool and
          then modified the points with the very useful "edit paths by nodes"
          tool. I think he turned out really cute!

              After scrolling through google images for inspiration, I decided
              to create my own logo for an architecture and interior design
              company. I think this logo does a good job of showing that this
              hypothetical company does both, having the house with furniture
              inside shows the interior design portion and the three buildings
              all together shows architecture. In this image, I used the
              rectangle shape tool to create that black silhouette of a building
              on the left side, and I used the circle tool to create the
              circular frame for the logo. For the chimney on the house, I drew
              a pentagon and then used the "difference" path tool to cut out an
              unneccesary corner of the chimney where it overlaps with the
              house.

              I decided to snap a picture of the living room in my apartment and
              use that as a reacing/photo reference to make a sketch-like
              drawing. I used the circle shape tool for the clock, and the
              rectangle shape tool for the TV. Everything else was mostly
              created with the bezier curve/straight line tool, but the plant
              was hand-drawn and modified. Lastly, the exclusion tool was used
              on the feet of the plant pot, to exclude unnecessary parts.

                I used InkScape to make this logo. I started with a reference
                photo of a baby elephant that I found on Google Images, and then
                from there I traced it, modified it and simplified it until it
                became this cute little minimalist outline. I'm trying to convey
                a soft, safe feeling with the typography and color scheme. I was
                thinking this would be a cute baby clothing brand, maybe
                specializing in boy's clothes, or it could be unisex. The font I
                used is a bit playful and has a slight hand-written feel to it,
                but it also maintains a clean professional look, and wrapping
                the text around the logo ties it all together neatly.
